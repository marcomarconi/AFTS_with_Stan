Most of the models listed in chapter 2 were already translated into Stan as part of the official documentation and can be found at <https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_26/stan-users-guide/time-series-chapter.html>. Still, we will go through them in the current document.

## SIMPLE AR MODELS

The typical AR(K) model can be coded in Stan as follow:

```{r show_AR_model, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
```

### Example 2.1.

The first example applies ar AR(3) to the quarterly growth rate of U.S.
real gross national product (GNP), seasonally adjusted, from the second quarter
of 1947 to the first quarter of 1991.

```{r plot_gnp, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
